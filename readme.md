A simple fruit thrower based on gestures.

Developed as a homework for the Human-Computer Interaction course of the Master in Computer Game Development.


## Aim of the Project

The homework required to create a 3D scene with photogrammetry and then place it in a Unity game with a simple mechanic,
playing with interactions of 3D objects with the real image.

This was my first game project at all, so it's more of an introduction to the Unity Engine in general,
as well as a practical mixed/augmented-reality application.
