A simple fruit thrower based on gestures.

Developed as a homework for the Human-Computer Interaction course of the Master in Computer Game Development.


## Aim of the Project

The homework required to create a 3D scene with photogrammetry and then place it in a Unity game with a simple mechanic,
playing with interactions of 3D objects with the real image.

This was my first game project at all, so it is more of an introduction to the Unity Engine in general,
as well as a practical mixed/augmented-reality application.


## Technical Details

### Gesture-based Fruit Throw

I implemented a simple gesture recognition inside
[`GameController`](Assets/Scripts/GameController.cs),
based on the last points of the cursor. \
The controller discards all points except the last few,
in order to better represent inertia in fast movements,
otherwise it would also consider previous slow movements,
that should not contribute to the final applied force. \
Handling the result is simple:
the longer the vector, the faster the gesture,
since points are further away from each other in the same period of time (last few frames).

The applied force has three-dimensions though,
so how to represent it with a two-dimensional gesture on the screen? \
The [`FruitThrower`](Assets/Scripts/FruitThrower.cs) interprets is as a three-dimensional vector like this:
- Horizontal axis: it is directly proportional to the gesture horizontal magnitude.
  It also depends on how far from the middle of the screen the fruit is released,
  to accomodate perspective (the result would not look too realistic otherwise).
- Forward axis: it is simply the vertical magnitude of the gesture.
- Vertical axis: this is the third information that has to be made up.
  I decided to consider the throw curve to be higher when the gesture is released on a higher point of the screen.
  It also depends on the general force of the throw (forward force),
  so that it is not always exactly the same.

### Real 3D Environment Scanning

The game scene is a 2D image, but objects are able to interact with an underlying 3D world.
This has been reconstructed with a photogrammetry software (3DF Zephyr), using the very same photos used as background.

Zephyr is able to export intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera used for the reconstruction,
so it is fairly easy to place the images and configure Unity's cameras to simulate the actual ones.

### Automated Camera Parameters Setup

Cameras' setup has been automated via script,
by completely rewriting in C# the MATLAB logic that was provided.

This enables the scene to be dynamically changed without manual setup,
allowing multiple scenes, camera switches, and other features to be performed effortlessly.

This game, specifically, can move the camera to a different position via gesture,
based on real images used for the scene reconstruction.

### Simulated Depth Occlusions

Other than providing collisions to 3D objects,
the underlying real-world 3D model is able to occlude them based on depth. \
This is made by using a set of two cameras:
- A UI camera that only renders the background image.
- A 3D camera that renders all 3D objects in the scene.
  Scene models use a custom material,
  which applies a flat texture representing a cut-out of the background image,
  rendered by the UI camera. \
  This makes them perfectly identical to the background image,
  but still allows for depth occlusions to be taken into account.
